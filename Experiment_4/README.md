## 🎯 AIM

To understand and implement iterative control structures in PostgreSQL conceptually, including **FOR loops**, **WHILE loops**, and basic **LOOP constructs**, for repeated execution of database logic.

---

## 🛠️ Tools Used

* PostgreSQL

---

## 📌 OBJECTIVES

* To understand why iteration is required in database programming
* To learn the purpose and behavior of FOR, WHILE, and LOOP constructs
* To understand how repeated data processing is handled in databases
* To relate loop concepts to real-world batch processing scenarios
* To strengthen conceptual knowledge of procedural SQL used in enterprise systems

---

## 🧩 Practical / Experiment Steps

---

### 🔹 Step 1: FOR Loop – Simple Iteration

**Description:**

* The loop runs a fixed number of times
* Each iteration represents one execution cycle
* Useful for understanding basic loop behavior

**Query:**

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
i INTEGER;
BEGIN
FOR i IN 1..5 LOOP
RAISE NOTICE 'Number is:- %',i;

END LOOP;
END $$;
```

---

### 🔹 Step 2: FOR Loop with Query (Row-by-Row Processing)

**Description:**

* The loop processes database records one at a time
* Each iteration handles a single row
* Simulates cursor-based processing

**Query:**

```sql
CREATE TABLE employee (
    emp_id INT,
    emp_name VARCHAR(50),
    salary INT
);

INSERT INTO employee VALUES
(1, 'Amit', 30000),
(2, 'Neha', 40000),
(3, 'Rahul', 35000);

DO $$
DECLARE
    rec RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN SELECT * FROM employee LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'ID: %, Name: %, Salary: %',
        rec.emp_id, rec.emp_name, rec.salary;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

**Output:** <img width="703" height="325" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0417ce97-71d7-43f0-ab32-ef265f2d4634" />

---

### 🔹 Step 3: WHILE Loop – Conditional Iteration

**Description:**

* The loop runs until a condition becomes false
* Execution depends entirely on the condition
* The condition is checked before every iteration

**Query:**

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
	sum INTEGER := 1;
BEGIN
	WHILE sum <= 5 LOOP
		RAISE NOTICE 'Sum is : %',sum;
		sum := sum + 1;
	END LOOP;

END $$;
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: LOOP with EXIT WHEN

**Description:**

* The loop does not stop automatically
* An explicit exit condition controls termination
* Gives flexibility in complex logic

**Query:**

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    num INTEGER := 1;
BEGIN
    LOOP
        RAISE NOTICE 'Number: %', num;
        num := num + 1;

        EXIT WHEN num > 5;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```

**Output:** <img width="609" height="341" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/df76b5a0-15a5-49e0-be91-e4b39644e0b5" />

---

### 🔹 Step 5: Salary Increment Using FOR Loop

**Description:**

* Employee records are processed one by one
* Salary values are updated iteratively
* Represents real-world payroll processing

**Query:**

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    rec RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN SELECT * FROM employee LOOP
        UPDATE employee
        SET salary = salary + 2000
        WHERE emp_id = rec.emp_id;
    END LOOP;
END $$;

SELECT * FROM employee;
```

**Output:** <img width="709" height="394" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e707f71-de3d-429d-90bd-6a3c7d00b662" />

---

### 🔹 Step 6: Combining LOOP with IF Condition

**Description:**

* Loop processes each record
* Conditional logic classifies data during iteration
* Demonstrates decision-making inside loops

**Query:**

```sql
DO $$
DECLARE
    rec RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR rec IN SELECT * FROM employee LOOP
        IF rec.salary >= 40000 THEN
            RAISE NOTICE '% is High Salary Employee', rec.emp_name;
        ELSE
            RAISE NOTICE '% is Normal Salary Employee', rec.emp_name;
        END IF;
    END LOOP;
END $$;
```
